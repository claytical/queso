Coded by Clay Ewing (c.ewing@miami.edu)

This software is free, as in free beer.  However, if you modify the source code, give me, let me know about it.  Maybe even fork it.  It was built with Code Igniter and Twitter Bootstrap.

2. Create a MySQL database and run gameful.sql on it.
3. Open up application/config/database.php and change the database name/user/password to match what you've setup in step 2.
4. Open up application/config/config.php and modify the base URL to the appropriate URL.
