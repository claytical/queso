      <h2>Game Development and Interactive Media</h2>
      <p>This is an introductory course about game design, theory and development and how games align themselves as a lens of study for all interactive media.  The principles from video games, sports games, party games, and serious games will be analyzed and applied to conceptualizing and designing two non-digital games. As a class we will be playing games that demonstrate design principles, along with making and analyzing games in order to build a common and more extensive vocabulary to both discuss and understand the form of these systems.</p>
